# Classify_retinal_damage
Classify retinal damage from OCT Scans

### Introduction:
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique that uses coherent light to capture high-resolution images of biological tissues. OCT is heavily used by ophthalmologists to obtain high-resolution images of the eye retina.

OCT is an emerging biomedical imaging technology that offers non-invasive real-time, high-resolution imaging of highly scattering tissues. It is widely used by ophthalmologist to perform diagnostic imaging on the structure of the anterior eye and the retina.

### Project Goal:
In this project, we will classify the OCT scans to classify the retinal disease. We can either implement models from scratch or use pre-trained models and fine-tune it for our application.
